I figured out the init issue, when Zach started the UCost search, when declaring a Fifo in the init() function of
the UCost class, he passed, Fifo(PriorityQueue) but this was not necessary as the Fifo class is already a sub class of
the PQ class and the Fifo class does not take any arguements but self.

New bug: the UCost function isn't working properly and isn't solving the puzzle.

From Campuswire:
There's a built-in method in solver.py called get_cost. It iterates through the path of the given state,
and for each consecutive pair of states in that path, it uses two specific lines of code to calculate
the cost to get from the first state to the second. You can copy those two lines (and IIRC reformat the variables
a little to work with your own implementation of UCSSolver) to make a helper method that calculates the cost from
any state to any other state (the cost will be accurate if the transition is one step only and is valid).

So there is an issue with how I am setting up the UCost function. I need to check it again but may need to go to
Office hours tomorrow. 4-9pm.

Once UCost is done, AStar should not be that bad, they are very similar
